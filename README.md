Overview
--------

The idea behind this plugin is that github already knows which users are committers on specific projects.

So we should be able to have an authentication process using OAuth that allows users to login to jenkins using their github credentials.

There are two key parts to this plugin:

A. GithubSecurityRealm: 

This handles the authentication and acquisition of the github oauth token for the connecting user.

This takes the client id and client secret from the application registration here: https://github.com/settings/applications/new

The entry should look like this:

Main URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080
Callback URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080/securityRealm/finishLogin

With 127.0.0.1:8080 replaced with the hostname and port of your jenkins instance.


B. GithubAuthorizationStrategy:

This defines:

1. Comma separated list of users that should be given admin privileges.

2. Comma separated list of organizations whose members should be given read and build permissions on the jobs.

3. Check box to give other authenticated users read permission.

4. Check box to allow anonymous users READ permission for the /github-webhook.  
This only has meaning if the github-plugin is installed and the remote github repository post commit hook has been setup accordingly.

5. Check box to allow anonymous users READ permission for the ```/job/*/badge/icon``` [embeddable build status icon](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Embeddable+Build+Status+Plugin).

Notes:

The user must be a public member in the organizations that are declared.
