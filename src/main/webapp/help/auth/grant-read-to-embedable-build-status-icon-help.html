        The <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Embeddable+Build+Status+Plugin">Embeddable Build Status
        Plugin</a>
        allows Jenkins to expose the current status of your build as an image in a fixed URL. You can put this URL into
        other sites
        (such as GitHub README) so that people can see the current state of the build.

        By enabling this permission you grant anonymous external READ access to the <b>/job/*/badge/icon</b> URLs so
        that the icon is accessible.<br/>
        e.g. http://localhost:8080/jenkins/job/jobName/badge/icon
