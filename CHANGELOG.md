# Version 0.22.2 (Released July 25, 2015)

* The wiki page was having issues rendering plugin information. Unless I
  renamed it back (tracked by [JENKINS-29636][JENKINS-29636]). I renamed the
  wiki page back to "Github OAuth Plugin" so plugin info would be rendered. I
  released 0.22.2 to revert release 0.22.1.


# Version 0.22.1 (Released July 25, 2015)

* I renamed the wiki page to "Github Authentication Plugin" which caused the
  plugin to disappear from the update center (tracked by
  [JENKINS-29636][JENKINS-29636]). I released the plugin with the new wiki link.
